# Mineswepper
## Description
Minesweeper is a game where players strategically uncover squares on a grid, aiming to clear all safe cells without clicking on any mines. Each uncovered square displays a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it, which players use to deduce which neighboring squares are safe and which hide mines.
